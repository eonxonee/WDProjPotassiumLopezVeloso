# Q3 Proposal Update
## Final Title: Kallergis Conundrukm
## Features:
  * Works on phone and laptops
  * Has a "Notes App" in which users can type in their gathered information as well as their theories
  * Has a "Guess the Word" game and a "Guess the Number" game both with attempt limits and hints about the mystery!
  * Has a "Guess the Perpetrator" feature where the user can guess who killed Aretta...
  * Has a working clock and day counter
## Details:
  * The Notes App will use HTML to make the structure which will be a text editor-type popover. JS will also be used to make the notepad work.
  * The Guessing games utilize containers and if-else statements
  * Guess the perpretrator will also use HTML and JS to make a website where users can input a name of who they think the murderer is.
  * The clock uses JS to constantly get the actual time when the users play. The day counter changes based on the current time (every time the clock displays 19, 38, 57 minutes) and cannot be reset as it will be saved to local storage.
  * JS and CSS will also be used for animations and design
    
## Definition of Done: For both of us, our work would be done for the 3rd Quarter if all Notes and Final "Guess the Perpetrator" of our mystery game work, the design is pleasing to look at, and the story is coherent, intriguing, and keeps users playing!

## Title: Kallergis Conundrum
## Subtitle: The Murder Mystery Begins

## Description: 
Welcome to Aretta’s Laptop. In this murder mystery-style RPG, you play as Cain Fratrisida, a detective whose career depends entirely on one case. Aretta Kallergis, 21 years old, has mysteriously died of natural causes. However, is that really all there is to her story? That is for you to find out.

On this journey, you encounter various friends and foes that aid you in uncovering the truth. You may even discover deep secrets you wished you never found out...

You have been granted permission to search through the victim's laptop. Do **NOT** leave anything unturned. Images, texts, all these may be useful for your case.

## How JS will be Used on Homepage: 
As seen in the layout, it mimics a laptop with apps and documents the player can open. Included is a button that opens a guessing game for who the murderer is and ends the game once the player guesses it right. Embedded in the footer is the player’s notes app where all the important information regarding the case will be stored and available to access anytime. Javascript will also be used for the miscellaneous apps shown on the screen (the mock “documents” and “images”).
