## Title: Kallergis Conundrum
## Subtitle: The Murder Mystery Begins

## Description: 
Welcome to Aretta’s Laptop. In this murder mystery-style RPG, you play as Cain Fratrisida, a detective whose career depends entirely on one case. Aretta Kallergis, 21 years old, has mysteriously died of natural causes. However, is that really all there is to her story? That is for you to find out.

On this journey, you encounter various friends and foes that aid you in uncovering the truth. You may even discover deep secrets you wished you never found out...

You have been granted permission to search through the victim's laptop. Do **NOT** leave anything unturned. Images, texts, all these may be useful for your case.

## How JS will be Used on Homepage: 
As seen in the layout, it mimics a laptop with apps and documents the player can open. Included is a button that opens a guessing game for who the murderer is and ends the game once the player guesses it right. Embedded in the footer is the player’s notes app where all the important information regarding the case will be stored and available to access anytime. Javascript will also be used for the miscellaneous apps shown on the screen (the mock “documents” and “images”).
